# module_11_challenge

For this challenge I used skills I've learned in class (Pandas, scraping the web, matplotlib, etc.), as well as help from a tutoring session to complete the work. I often use the following websites to brush up on code syntax:
  1. Geeks for Geeks
  2. Stack Overflow
  3. Spark By {Examples}
  4. Pandas documentation library

I also used the class slack to get help on the portion of the homework that asked about determining the number of earth days in a martian year. My tutoring session was the most helpful to me this week, as I still find web scraping a bit confusing.
